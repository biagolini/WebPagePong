# Snake Game

A simple implementation of the classic Pong game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is designed to provide a lightweight and easy-to-understand version of the game, suitable for testing infrastructure services, learning purposes, or as a starting point for further development.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone or download the repository to your local machine. Once downloaded, open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to start playing the game.

## How to Play

The left paddle is controlled by moving your mouse up and down. The right paddle is controlled by the AI. The goal is to hit the ball with your paddle and make it pass the opponent's paddle. The game will continue indefinitely, and there is no score tracking in this simple implementation.

# Files

- index.html: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the game.
- style.css: The CSS file that contains the styling for the game.
- script.js: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic and functionality.
